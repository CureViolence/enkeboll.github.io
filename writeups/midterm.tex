\section{Introduction}
Cure Violence is a non-profit focused on stopping the spread of violence (e.g., gun violence) in communities (both domestic and international) by using the methods and strategies associated with disease control Ð detecting and interrupting conflicts, identifying and treating the highest risk individuals, and changing social norms. Specifically, they focus on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Detecting and interrupting potentially violent conflicts by preventing retaliations and mediating conflicts by being on-the- ground within communities
\item Identifying and treating highest risk through assessing high risk candidates, changing behavior, and providing treatment through 1-on-1 case work
\item Mobilizing the community to change norms by responding to every shooting, organize community events and people, and spreading positive norms
\end{enumerate}





\section{Approach} 
description of data driven process from ideation to formalization of recommendations

\section{Plan / Milesones}
Cost benefit analysis - simple
How many Incidents were avoided, multiplied by the cost saving scalar
Extract data from reports
Cost benefit analysis - complex
Comparison to national averages in Chicago/Baltimore
Exploration of the government data
Lift of incidents avoided
Joining and consolidating internal and external government datasets
Solid path forward for cure violence of where to go next from a cost benefit analysis perspective

\section{Data Collections and Analysis}
\subsection{Public Reports}
Johns Hopkins University: Baltimore, 2012


Data from the Baltimore Police Department for homicides and nonfatal shootings from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2010
Surveys of program participants from 2007 - 2010
Average of 30 - 40 participants taking and tracking surveys

Three of the four program sites experienced large, statistically significant, program related reductions in homicides or nonfatal shootings without having a counter-balancing significant increase in one of these outcome measures.


UI Chicago: Chicago, 2009

Northwestern University: Chicago, 2014

Raw crime counts show a 31\% reduction in homicide, a 7\% reduction in total violent crime, and a 19\% reduction in shootings in the targeted districts.
These effects are significantly greater than the effects expected given the declining trends in crime in the city as a whole.
Reduced levels of total violent crime, shootings, and homicides remained constant
The effects of the intervention were immediate
It is not likely that effects were due to increased police activity
