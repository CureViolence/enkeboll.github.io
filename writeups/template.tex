\section{Introduction}
Cure Violence is a non-profit focused on stopping the spread of violence (e.g., gun violence) in communities (both domestic and international) by using the methods and strategies associated with disease control Ð detecting and interrupting conflicts, identifying and treating the highest risk individuals, and changing social norms. Specifically, they focus on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Detecting and interrupting potentially violent conflicts by preventing retaliations and mediating conflicts by being on-the- ground within communities
\item Identifying and treating highest risk through assessing high risk candidates, changing behavior, and providing treatment through 1-on-1 case work
\item Mobilizing the community to change norms by responding to every shooting, organize community events and people, and spreading positive norms
\end{enumerate}
